                <p> Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease, mainly affecting the skin.
                    It is curable and treatment provided in the early stages averts
                    disability. It is curable with MDT (multi drug therapy); a belief
                    like leprosy is a divine curse, a punishment of the past sins
                    and results of immoral sexual behavior are still prevalent.
                </p>
                <p>When a person is identified with leprosy in the society,
                    he/she suffers economic and social losses, as well as participation
                    restrictions in the community. Stigma attached to leprosy leads to
                    loss of employment even before manual labour becomes more difficult
                    due to disability that often results from late or no treatment.
                    It also leads to exclusion from society, causing physical and emotional distress.

                    In India, Each of the village or city has a separate slum for
                    leprosy-affected people, which is isolated from community,
                    Even if you go to any bigger cities you will found at least
                    one slum for leprosy, even in the suburb of Mumbai has this.
                </p>
                <p style="width:678px;">This is mainly near by the railway stations or suburban railway stations.
                    The patient is isolated by the community and does not have any earning source.
                    There self-respect becomes low, and finally they have to do the work of
                    collecting metal or plastic scraps or garbage.
                    Many time due to easy money the start making country liquor or
                    selling the drugs or even making small robbery.
                </p>
                <p style="width:678px;">The only way to bring them in mainstream was by providing them treatment
                    and rehabilitation.
