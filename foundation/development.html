                <p>As narrated by Padma Chaphekar, with the instinct of developing
                    ability center for the disabled, Dada Chaphekar had first meeting
                    with Mr. Lagu. Mr BB Mehendale Govt officer of Public welfare department.

                </p>
                <p>Aim was to create a hall in the land for ability center.
                    The first shade was made from corrugated steel sheet, a young entrepreneur
                    in city named Prakash Baldota donated those sheet and helped to construct the shed.
                    The first five members named Rashid, Lakshman, Maridas, Agatrao, Mehendale
                    made the shade with the woods, and sheets.

                <p>
                    National chemical laboratory at pune donated the rubber moulds and powder
                    for making the chalks. They also provided the training of making the chalks.
                    Afterwards pune municipal corporation gave the order of 5000 flat files,
                    TELCO (now Tata Motors) gave the order of box file. And the ability center started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data Chaphekar was ignited with the thought of dream ability center,
                    where the view was society should not look at disabled people
                    with the view of charity but to pay the returns to disabled for
                    the product and services provided at equal quality of able person do.
                </p>

                    The nearest medical facility was at Kondhava at north-east of pune city
                    almost 40 KM away at that time.
