                    <strong>Late Anant Gopal Chaphkear</strong>, an Electrical Engineer by education tried
                    his hands at agriculture joined New Prakash Mills at Dhule,Maharashtra
                    and received the most unfortunate blow by the hands of destiny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He contracted Leprosy, the most dreadful, feared disease.
                    He was forced to quit his employment and return to his native place,
                    Talegaon,Pune, Maharashtra.
                </p>
                <p>Financial position of Anant Chaphekar was sound and thence;
                    Mr Anant Chaphekar survived and maintained his dignity. But, he could not ignore the woe of his brethren.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His inquisitiveness to understand the disease and the consequential
                    wrath of the society, the hardships caused on the patients fuelled
                    his compassionate heart.

                <p>At the same time, by accident, he got the opportunity to read a book
                    by Henry Viscardi <strong>Give us the tools</strong>, a story about
                    a company run by disabled after the world war founded to give dignity
                    and self reliance to the disabled.
                </p>
                <p>It clearly said that unless the disables run a business similar to
                    management practice as the non-disable does, there won't be a dignity
                    for the disabled person. </p>
                <p>A friend of Dada Chaphekar , <strong>Mr Ravindra Desai</strong> has
                    translated the book Marathi language as <strong>Hat Na Pasaru Kadhi</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was <strong>The story of Ability center</strong> that sowed the seeds
                    of Udyogdham. Mr Chaphekar's wife, Smt Padma Chaphekar and many like-minded
                    people have supported this cause making it possible for Udyogdham to complete
