                            in Maharashtra, where the leprosy affected families are not able
                            to raise up there pupil due to poor income and social stigma
                            towards them. It is effort to nurture the child from unprivileged

                            Aniket Niketan Based on our rich experience years with
                            leprosy patients, udygodham founders  realized that
                            the children of leprosy patients were in more adverse
                            conditions and the incident of leprosy in their families
                            posed a threat to their future. This Aniket Niketan was established 
                            for the children of leprosy patients.</p>
