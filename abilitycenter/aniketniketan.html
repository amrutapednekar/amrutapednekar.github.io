                        Aniket Niketan Based on our rich experience years with
                        leprosy patients, udygodham founders  realized that
                        the children of leprosy patients were in more adverse
                        conditions and the incident of leprosy in their families
                        posed a threat to their future. This Aniket Niketan was established
                        for the children of leprosy patients.</p>
